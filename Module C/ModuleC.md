| System Requirement Description No.1 … | Test Execution Order | Expected Results |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| No                                    |                      |                  |
| The security system must have a motion sensor that activates when the owner leaves the apartment | Test run of the motion sensor based on a rangefinder | The sensor sends a signal to activate the drone |
| User-friendly interface               | Use of the system’s main functions through the interface | The system can be managed via an intuitive interface |
| Integration into a smart home for easy implementation with various sensor sets | System management through a smart home hub, e.g., Alice | The system can be controlled via Alice |
| The drone should have an easy block-based route-building system for the user | Route building through block programming | The route is built using a block-based system |
| The drone must have a function for autonomous human recognition via AI | Debugging human recognition | A trained neural network is ready |
| Computer vision should determine the contour of a person from the back, side, and in a mask | Test checks in complex poses | More than half of the complex frames are recognized |
| The same functionality should be implemented through a ground-based unmanned vehicle (rover) | Scenario run with the rover | Successfully executed case with the rover |
